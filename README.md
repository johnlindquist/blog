## Purpose

Run `blog "My New Blog Post"`

- Creates a markdown file named `my-new-blog-post.md` in your content directory
- Fills out the frontmatter: title, slug, date, published
- Launches your Gatsby server (if not already running)
- Opens your browser directly to your new post
- Opens VS Code to your new markdown file

## Setup

- git clone
- `npm i`
- change paths in `index.js` to match your filesystem
- `npm i -g ./` inside your folder

The `blog` command should be globally available.
